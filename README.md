* built a chatbot to answer FAQs on GST using RASA NLU Framework with telegram integration
* ## Abstract 
  ### MNCâ€™s like Amazon, Zomato, Swiggy, etc. have been ahead of the curve in aspects of building chatbots, but not the Indian Government.
  ### When the GST laws were implemented, aimed to usurp corruption right from the roots, naturally the number of people being blindly looted in the name of GST, like truckers, shopkeepers, etc was on the rise. This is the target demographic of our chatbot as we have personally faced this innumerable times. Keeping this in mind, our project aims to develop a new found chatbot based on Natural language understanding that makes the process of searching easy, timesaving and eliminate the probability of irrelevant information.
